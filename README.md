## üîà Voice Interrupter Discord Bot [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-Discord-blueviolet)](https://discord.gg/DGeqAgcMnF)

A Discord Bot that plays an annoying sound over a targetted user. It uses **[guildMemberSpeaking()](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/v12/class/Client?scrollTo=e-guildMemberSpeaking)** event to play a sound whenever the target user speaks.

‚öô **How it works**
* The Bot _waits_ for the **Targetted User** to join a Voice Channel. 
* When the **Targetted User** joins a Voice Channel, the bot would join _along_ with the User.
* It will then _play an annoying sound_ whenever the **Targetted User** speaks.
* The bot _leaves_ along with the **Targetted User**.
